CrewAI Podcast Script Writer

This script demonstrates a two-agent system for creating podcast scripts:
1. Research Agent - Gathers information from the web using DuckDuckGo
2. Podcast Script Agent - Converts research into an engaging, humorous podcast script

The agents work sequentially to produce a complete podcast script from a given topic.
